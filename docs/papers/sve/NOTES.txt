Need to preempt notion that b/c the factors are polynomial that the 
work is trivial.

Issue is that these are piecewise polynomials over arbitrary convex
regions and that the upper and lower integral bounds are themselves
piecewise symbolic functions.  To the best of our knowledge, no
previous work has worked through an algorithm for performing these
integrals in closed-form, much less efficiently via the use of
data structures.
