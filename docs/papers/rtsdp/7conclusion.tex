The proposed Continuous RTDP algorithm can use heuristic search to speed up the solution of DC-MDPs in exchange for a solution focused on the relevant states. This is the first algorithm to use asynchronous symbolic dynamic programming and heuristic search. For future work, there are many possibilities of improvement: better convergency and anytime solution quality are likely to be obtained with the labelling~\cite{Bonet03LRTDP} and online~\cite{kolobov12GOURMAND} modifications. Also, a very important factor to improve performance that should be explored is to use more informative heuristics that can greatly reduce the number of relevant regions.
