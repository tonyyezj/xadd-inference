Previous exact solutions for HMDP were often limited to hyper-rectangular partitions~(\cite{feng04,li05}). SDP~\cite{sanner11,zamani12} allows general piecewise functions, but generates an expensive to compute complete policy.

The most relevant existing heuristic search solution for HMDPs is given in \cite{meuleau09HAO}; however, its requirement of monotonic use of resources and hyper-rectangular regions is more restrictive than our model. As far as we know, this is the only work to use a continuous region based Bellman update operation, and that uses heuristic search to compute a partial policy that generalizes beyond visited states.
