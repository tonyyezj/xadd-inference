%- linear to constant gain in representation for step functions

In this work, we introduced a novel bounded approximate symbolic
dynamic programming (BASDP) algorithm for HMDPs based on XADD
approximation, where we contributed a bounded error compression technique
for XADDs involving the solution of a constrained bilinear saddle
point problem.  After exploiting a number of key insights in the
structure of this problem, we were able to show that it could be solved
to optimality in finite time via constraint generation in a linear
programming framework (despite having an apparent infinite set of
potential constraints).  Empirically, this BASDP solution yielded
order-of-magnitude speedups over the exact solution in exchange for a
small approximation error, thus vastly expanding the range of HMDPs
for which bounded error approximate solutions are possible.
