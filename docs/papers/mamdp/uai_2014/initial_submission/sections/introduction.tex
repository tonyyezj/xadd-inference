Modelling competitive sequential interactions between agents has
important applications within economics and decision-making.
Stochastic games \cite{Shapley_PotNAoS_1953} provide a convenient
framework to model sequential interactions between non-cooperative
agents. In zero-sum stochastic games, participating agents have
diametrically opposing goals. A reinforcement learning solution to
zero-sum stochastic games with discrete states was presented in
\cite{Littman_ICML_1994}.  Closed-form solutions for the continuous
state case remain unknown, despite the general importance of this
formalism --- zero-sum continuous state stochastic games provide a
convenient framework with which to model robust sequential
optimisation in adversarial settings including many important
financial and economic domains such as option valuation on derivative
markets.

The difficulty of solving zero-sum continuous state stochastic games
arises from the need to calculate a Nash equilibrium for every state,
of which there are infinitely many. In this paper we characterise a
subclass of continuous state stochastic games for which we can
calculate exact solutions for arbitrary horizons 
via closed-form symbolic dynamic programming
(SDP)~\cite{Boutilier_IJCAI_2001} in 
continuous domains~\cite{Sanner_UAI_2011,Zamani_AAAI_2012}.

We begin by presenting Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) \cite{Howard_1960} 
and value iteration \cite{Bellman_1957}, a commonly used dynamic programming
solution for MDPs. We then describe both discrete and continuous state 
zero-sum stochastic games as game-theoretic generalisations of the MDP framework. 
Following this we show how symbolic dynamic programming
can be used to calculate the first known exact solution to a particular subclass of 
zero-sum continuous stochastic games. We conclude by calculating
exact solutions to continuous state matching pennies and a binary
option valuation game.

In this paper we make the following key contributions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item We characterise a subclass of zero-sum continuous stochastic
    games with restricted reward and transition functions that can be
    solved exactly via parameterised linear optimisation.
  \item We provide an algorithm that solves this subclass of
    stochastic games exactly and optimally using symbolic dynamic
    programming for arbitrary horizons.
\end{itemize}

%The key insight of this paper lies within the characterisation of a subclass
%of zero-sum continuous state stochastic games with restricted reward
%functions that can be solved via parameterised linear optimisation. We 
%show that this particular subset of games can be solved both symbolically and optimally
%for arbitrary horizons.
