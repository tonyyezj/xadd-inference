Zero-sum stochastic games provide a formalism to study competitive
sequential interactions between two agents with diametrically opposing
goals and evolving state.  A solution to such games in the case of a
discrete state, was presented in \cite{Littman_ICML_1994}. The
continuous state case, however, remains unsolved. In many instances
this requires nonlinear parameterised optimisation, a problem for
which closed-form solutions are generally unavailable. We characterise
a subclass of continuous stochastic games and present a novel symbolic
dynamic programming method which enables these problems to be reduced
to a parameterised linear program, for which an exact closed-form
solution exists. This solution is empirically applied to compute
\emph{exact} solutions to a variety of \emph{continuous state}
zero-sum stochastic games.
