Zero-sum stochastic games provide a formalism to study competitive sequential 
interactions between two agents with diametrically opposing goals and evolving 
state. A solution to such games with discrete state was presented by Littman \cite{Littman_ICML_1994}. 
The continuous state version of this game remains unsolved. In many instances 
continuous state solutions require nonlinear optimisation, a problem for which 
closed-form solutions are generally unavailable. We present an exact closed-form 
solution to a subclass of zero-sum continuous stochastic games that can be solved
as a parameterised linear program by utilising symbolic dynamic programming.
This novel technique is applied to calculate exact solutions to a variety of zero-sum
continuous state stochastic games.
