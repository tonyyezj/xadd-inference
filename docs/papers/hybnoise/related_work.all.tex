%%HYBRID SYSTEMS

Hybrid systems are a class of dynamical systems that involve both
continuous and discrete dynamics. The dynamics of the continuous
variables are defined typically through differential equations and the
evolution of the discrete variables through finite state machines,
Petri nets or other abstract computational machines. One accepted
manner to model hybrid systems is using hybrid automata that
represents, in a single formalism, the discrete changes by automata
transitions and the continuous changes by differential
equations \cite{DeSHee:2009,Henzinger:1997}.  One special class of
hybrid systems are the switched linear systems that have a collection
of subsystems defined by linear dynamics (differential equations) and
a switching rule that specifies the switching between the
subsystems \cite{Sun:2005}.

One problem that has been studied in the area of hybrid systems is the
verification of the safety property, that tries to proof that the
system does not enter in unsafe configurations from an initial
configuration \cite{Tomlin:2003}. Then, we say that the system
satisfies the safety property if all reachable states are
safe \cite{Henzinger:1997}. There are many tools for the automatic
verification of hybrid systems such as HyTech \cite{Henzinger:1997},
KRONOS \cite{Yovine:1997}, PHAVer \cite{Frehse:05} and
HSOLVER \cite{Ratschan:2007}. All the techniques rely on the ability
to compute reachable sets of hybrid systems. For example, HyTech, a
symbolic model checker, automatically computes reachable sets for
linear hybrid automata, a subclass of hybrid automata. HyTech can also
return the values of design parameters for which this automata
satisfies a temporal-logic requirement \cite{Henzinger:1997}. Some
examples of verification of hybrid systems can be found
in \cite{Henzinger:1997,Mohrenschildt:2001}.

Another challenging topic in hybrid systems is to evaluate the effect
of the hybrid controller on the systems operation, i.e., to solve the
controllability problem for hybrid systems \cite{Stikkel:2004}. A
hybrid system is called hybrid controllable if, for any pair of valid
states, there exists at least one permitted control sequence (correct
control-laws) between them \cite{Tittus:1998,Yang:2007}. The general
controllability problem of hybrid systems is NP
hard \cite{Blondel:1999}. However, for special classes of hybrid
systems, some necessary and sufficient conditions for controllability
were obtained
in \cite{Stikkel:2004,Lemch:2001,Sun:2002,Zhenyu:2003,Yang:2007}.  For
example, by employing algebraic manipulation of system matrices, a
sufficient and necessary condition for the controllability analysis of
a class of piecewise linear hybrid systems is given in
{Zhenyu:2003}. This class is called controlled switching linear hybrid
system and have the following properties: all mode switches are
controllable, the dynamical subsystems within each mode has a LTI
form, the admissible operating regions within each mode is the whole
state space, and there are no discontinuous state jumps. The
controllability test for this class of hybrid system can be determined
based on the system matrices. In \cite{Yang:2007} is proposed an
approach for controllability analysis of a class of more complex
hybrid systems. This approach uses a discrete-path searching algorithm
that integrates global reachability analysis at the discrete event
system level and a local reachability analysis at the continuous
level. This method cannot guarantee the existence of a solution for an
arbitrary hybrid system \cite{Yang:2007}.

Much of the work on hybrid systems has focused on deterministic models
without allowing any uncertainty. In practice, there are real world
applications where the environment is inherent uncertainty. To cope
with this, the stochastic hybrid systems was proposed. Stochastic
hybrid systems allow uncertainty (1) replacing deterministic jumps
between discrete states by random jumps or (2) replacing the
deterministic dynamics inside the discrete state by a stochastic
differential equation or (3) combinations of 1 and 2 \cite{Hu:2000}. A
critical problem in this type of systems is the verification of
reachability properties because it is necessary to cope with the
interaction between the discrete and continuous stochastic dynamics,
in this case it is computed the probability that the system satisfies
the property \cite{Koutsoukos:2006}.  Related with the concept of
verification of safety property, in stochastic hybrid systems, the
system tries to maximize the probability that the execution will
remain in safe states as long as possible \cite{Hu:2000}.

%%CHANCE-CONSTRAINED CONTROL

Chance-constrained predictive stochastic control of dynamic systems
characterizes uncertainty in a probabilistic manner, and finds the
optimal sequence of control inputs subject to the constraint that the
probability of failure must be below a user-specified
threshold \cite{Blackmore:2011}. This constraint is known as a chance
constraint \cite{Blackmore:2011} and is used to define stochastic
robustness.

A great deal of work has taken place in recent years relating to
chance-constrained optimal control of linear systems subject to
Gaussian uncertainty in convex
regions \cite{Schwarm:1999,Li:2002,Ono:2008} and linear systems in
nonconvex regions \cite{Blackmore:2010,Blackmore:2011}.  The approach
in \cite{Blackmore:2010} uses samples, or ‘particles’, to approximate
the chance constraint, and hence does not guarantee satisfaction of
the constraint. It applies to arbitrary uncertainty distributions and
is significantly more computationally intensive than others. The
approach proposed in \cite{Blackmore:2011} uses analytic bound to
ensure satisfaction of the constraint and applies for linear-Gaussian
systems.
