\begin{abstract}
Recent advances in solutions to Hybrid MDPs with discrete and
continuous state and action spaces have significantly extended the
class of MDPs for which exact solutions can be derived, albeit at the
expense of a restricted transition noise model.  In this paper, we
work around limitations of previous solutions by adopting a robust
optimization approach in which Nature is allowed to adversarially
determine transition noise within pre-specified confidence
intervals.  This allows one to derive an optimal policy with an
arbitrary (user-specified) level of success probability and
significantly extends the class of transition noise models for which
Hybrid MDPs can be solved.  This work also significantly extends
results for the related ``chance-constrained'' approach in stochastic
hybrid control to accommodate state-dependent noise.  We demonstrate
our approach working on a variety of hybrid MDPs taken from AI
planning, operations research, and control theory, noting that this is
the first time optimal robust solutions have been automatically
derived for such problems.

%Continuous spaces with stochastic dynamics can represent a rich class
%of real world problems. While decision theoretic planning provides
%optimal solutions to restricted continuous domains, fully stochastic
%continuous states with continuous action spaces have not been solved
%without approximating techniques. Here we propose a symbolic dynamic
%programming (SDP) approach to provide an optimal closed-form solution
%for Stochastic Discrete and Continuous MDPs with piecewise linear
%dynamics. We show how noisy states are symbolically modelled and
%intuitively minimized in the value iteration algorithm with unknown
%%state parameters. The proposed algorithm uses the extended algebraic
%decision diagrams (XADDs) as an efficient data structure for SDPs to
%demonstrate empirical results on problems such as the Inventory
%Control. The results show the existence of the first fully automated
%exact solution to the stochastic noisy continuous problem definitions.
